# About Me

Hi, I'm András, a highly motivated frontend developer.

I have always loved computer science. I must have been thirteen years old, when I sorted the computer parts myself and built my first computer alone. My whole childehood was spent under the spell of computer science. Not only computer games intrested me, but also various editing programs. In high school, with Adobe Dreamweaver, a web development application, I created a fan website for my favorite game, where different informations about characters and background story could be found.

Unfortunately, in the last year of primary school, I made a bad decision and continued my studies at econimical high school, not in computer science. At the end of high school I chose computer science as my fifth graduation subject, where I was the only one in my grade who took a one hundred percent exam. Finally, I graduated as a teacher at University of Pécs.

About 2 years ago I noticed a Hungarian programming bootcamp advertisement. This was how it became clear, this would be a great opportunity to change career, so finally I could do what I wanted all in my life. I started preparing for a career change in a self-taught way. I really liked it, so I subscribed to the online platform of CodeBerry programming school, where I did almost all curriculum about front-end development alone. After that, I felt it's time to move on for significant development in my studies. To reach my goals, I was successfully admitted and completed the frontend development course at CodeCool. I just loved every moment of it.

I'm currently looking to contribute my skills to a team where I can prove my skills while growing in my capabilities. If you are looking for a competent, highly-motivated developer, contact me.
